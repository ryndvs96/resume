    %This was once an idea for a five-block Tetris game and has now turned into a mathematical endeavor for efficiency in grid-based algorithms. Because there is a finite number of pieces in any 4-block, 5-block, etc. Tetris game, these algorithms attempt to calculate all pieces for N-blocks with minimal time and memory consumption. They use a combination of Map functions and byte-pair compression to allow for faster recursive processes.
